This utility allows users to interact with Jenkins from the command line or from scripts.\nfor more information about jenikins cli refer to the documentationhttps://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/cli/#downloading-the-client\nJenkins CLI allows users to reference a file path using the syntax @[filepath], and Jenkins will replace it with the contents of the referenced file.\n\nUser Input: When using the Jenkins CLI, a user might input a command or script that includes references to files using the @[filepath] syntax. For example:\n bashCopy code\n jenkins-cli command @[path/to/file]\n\nInterpretation: Jenkins CLI interprets this syntax as a directive to read the contents of the specified file.\n\nFile Read Operation: Jenkins CLI then performs a file read operation, reading the contents of the specified file referenced in the command.\n\nReplacement: After reading the file contents, Jenkins replaces the @[filepath] syntax in the command&#x2F;script with the actual contents of the file.\n\nCommand Execution: Finally, Jenkins executes the modified command or script with the replaced file contents.\n\n\ni downloaded the jenikins cli using the wget command \n\nthe command java -jar jenikind-cli.jar -s ‘ip:port’ help to give the list of all the commands \n──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/builder]└─$ java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s &#x27;http://10.129.230.169:8080&#x27; help kaliPicked up _JAVA_OPTIONS: -Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on -Dswing.aatext=true  add-job-to-view    Adds jobs to view.  build    Builds a job, and optionally waits until its completion.  cancel-quiet-down    Cancel the effect of the &quot;quiet-down&quot; command.  clear-queue    Clears the build queue.  connect-node    Reconnect to a node(s)  console    Retrieves console output of a build.  copy-job    Copies a job.  create-credentials-by-xml    Create Credential by XML  create-credentials-domain-by-xml    Create Credentials Domain by XML  create-job    Creates a new job by reading stdin as a configuration XML file.  create-node    Creates a new node by reading stdin as a XML configuration.  create-view    Creates a new view by reading stdin as a XML configuration.  declarative-linter    Validate a Jenkinsfile containing a Declarative Pipeline  delete-builds    Deletes build record(s).  delete-credentials    Delete a Credential  delete-credentials-domain    Delete a Credentials Domain  delete-job    Deletes job(s).  delete-node    Deletes node(s)  delete-view    Deletes view(s).  disable-job    Disables a job.  disable-plugin    Disable one or more installed plugins.  disconnect-node    Disconnects from a node.  enable-job    Enables a job.  enable-plugin    Enables one or more installed plugins transitively.  get-credentials-as-xml    Get a Credentials as XML (secrets redacted)  get-credentials-domain-as-xml    Get a Credentials Domain as XML  get-job    Dumps the job definition XML to stdout.  get-node    Dumps the node definition XML to stdout.  get-view    Dumps the view definition XML to stdout.  groovy    Executes the specified Groovy script.   groovysh    Runs an interactive groovy shell.  help    Lists all the available commands or a detailed description of single command.  import-credentials-as-xml    Import credentials as XML.
